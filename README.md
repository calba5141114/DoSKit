# DoSKit
In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.

# Purpose 
DoSKit is a security testing tool for Denial of Service attacks 
directed at one domain or another. This tool is intended to be used 
for stress testing and simulated DoS Attack. Never run DoSKit on a 
domain without the explicit permission of the owner. 

# Goals 
- Send 1 million requests per second with little memory usage. 
- Prevent useless resource usage. 
- Store Targets in a SQLITE DB that can be pulled up via the CLI
- Colors on the terminal (rgb)
